## üéØ **1. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **The Global Water Crisis**
- **2.3 billion people** worldwide face water scarcity
- **4.2 billion people** lack safely managed sanitation services
- **$260 billion** lost annually due to water-related issues

### **Real-World Problem We're Solving**
**Water scarcity and mismanagement in households and communities**

#### **Who is Affected:**
- **Families** who don't know when their water tanks will run empty
- **Communities** with no visibility into collective water usage
- **Property managers** managing multiple residential units
- **Municipalities** dealing with water distribution inefficiencies

#### **Why This Problem Matters:**
- **Sudden water shortages** disrupt daily life and cause panic
- **Overuse and wastage** due to lack of consumption awareness
- **No predictive insights** leading to reactive rather than proactive management
- **Community conflicts** over water distribution and usage
- **Economic losses** from water-related disruptions

#### **Current Pain Points:**
- ‚ùå Manual tank monitoring is unreliable and time-consuming
- ‚ùå No early warning system for water depletion
- ‚ùå Lack of community transparency in water usage
- ‚ùå No AI-powered insights for water management
- ‚ùå Reactive approach instead of predictive planning
